## Rust Toolchain Setup

MoFA requires a recent stable Rust toolchain. We target **Rust edition 2024**.

```bash
# Install rustup (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install the latest stable toolchain
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup default stable

# Verify installation
rustc --version   # should be 1.85+ for edition 2024 support
cargo --version

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mofa-org/mofa.git
cd mofa
```

---

## Common Commands

```bash
# Build the entire workspace
cargo build
cargo build --release

# Build a specific crate
cargo build -p mofa-sdk
cargo build -p mofa-cli

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for a specific crate (preferred for focused development)
cargo test -p mofa-sdk
cargo test -p mofa-runtime
cargo test -p mofa-plugins

# Run a specific test by name
cargo test -p mofa-sdk -- test_name

# Format code (run before every commit)
cargo fmt

# Check formatting without modifying files
cargo fmt --check

# Run the linter (must pass with no warnings before opening a PR)
cargo clippy

# Fast compilation check (no output artifacts)
cargo check

# Run the CLI
cargo run -p mofa-cli -- mofa --help
```

## Architecture Overview

Before making changes, please read:

- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** — Full architecture description, workspace structure, feature flags, and layering rules.
- **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)** — High-level design document.

### Workspace Structure

```

## Microkernel Layer Rules

MoFA enforces a strict layered architecture. Violating these rules will block a PR.

| Layer | Allowed | Forbidden |
|---|---|---|
| `mofa-kernel` | Trait definitions, core data types (`AgentInput`, `AgentOutput`, `AgentState`) | Concrete implementations, business logic |
| `mofa-foundation` | Concrete implementations, business-specific types | Re-defining kernel traits, depending on `mofa-foundation` from kernel |
| `mofa-plugins` | Plugin adapters and concrete plugin implementations | — |
| `mofa-sdk` | Re-exports of user-facing APIs | Heavy logic (delegate to lower crates) |

**Dependency direction** (arrows = "may depend on"):

```
mofa-sdk → mofa-runtime → mofa-foundation → mofa-kernel
mofa-plugins → mofa-foundation → mofa-kernel
```

`mofa-kernel` must **never** depend on `mofa-foundation` (circular dependency).

### Quick checklist before opening a PR

- [ ] New trait definitions live in `mofa-kernel`.
- [ ] Concrete `struct` implementations live in `mofa-foundation` or `mofa-plugins`.
- [ ] `mofa-foundation` does **not** re-define a trait already present in `mofa-kernel`.
- [ ] No new circular dependencies introduced (`cargo check` catches these).

## Branch Naming Conventions

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| New feature | `feature/<short-description>` | `feature/rhai-hot-reload` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<short-description>` | `fix/registry-deadlock` |
| Documentation | `docs/<short-description>` | `docs/add-contributing` |
| Refactor | `refactor/<short-description>` | `refactor/kernel-trait-split` |
| Chore / CI | `chore/<short-description>` | `chore/update-dependencies` |

Use **lowercase kebab-case** for all branch names.

---

## Commit Message Conventions

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`

**Scope** should be the crate name without the `mofa-` prefix (e.g., `kernel`, `foundation`, `sdk`, `cli`).

**Examples:**

```
feat(sdk): add secretary agent draft PR workflow
fix(runtime): resolve deadlock in AgentRegistry under high concurrency
docs(kernel): clarify trait definition placement rules
refactor(foundation): extract SimpleToolRegistry to its own module
```

- Keep the summary line under **72 characters**.
- Use the imperative mood ("add", "fix", "remove" — not "added" or "fixes").
- Reference issues in the footer: `Closes #42` or `Related to #17`.

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before opening a PR

1. **Fork** the repository and work on your own fork.
2. Base your branch on the latest `main`.
3. Run the full quality gate locally:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --check
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D errors
   cargo test --workspace --all-features
   cargo build --examples
   cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --all-features
   ```
4. Make sure every commit compiles on its own (`cargo check` per commit).

### Draft PRs

Open a **draft PR** early when:
- You want early feedback on direction before the implementation is complete.
- The change is large and you want to discuss the approach first.

Mark it as "Ready for review" only when all quality gates pass:
```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D errors
cargo test --workspace --all-features
cargo build --examples
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --all-features
```

### PR description template

```markdown
## Summary
<!-- What does this PR do? -->

## Motivation
<!-- Why is this change needed? -->

## Changes
<!-- Bullet list of what was changed and in which crate. -->

## Related Issues
<!-- Link to a related issue if present -->

## Testing
<!-- How was this tested? New unit tests? Manual verification? -->

## Checklist
- [ ] `cargo fmt --check` passes
- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D errors` passes
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace --all-features` passes
- [ ] `cargo build --examples` succeeds
- [ ] `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --all-features` succeeds
- [ ] Architecture layer rules respected (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Relevant documentation updated
```

### Review process

- At least **one maintainer approval** is required to merge.
- Address all review comments before requesting a re-review.
- Prefer small, focused PRs over large monolithic ones — they get reviewed faster.

### Automated PR Checks

All PRs must pass the **PR Guard** CI job before they can be merged. This check runs automatically and verifies:

1. **Clippy** - No compilation errors with all features enabled
2. **Tests** - All tests pass with all features enabled
3. **Examples** - All examples compile successfully
4. **Documentation** - Documentation builds without errors

```bash
# Run these locally before pushing to ensure your PR will pass
cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D errors   # Lint with all features
cargo test --workspace --all-features                   # Test with all features
cargo build --examples                                  # Build all examples
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --all-features          # Build documentation
```

**Note:** Branch protection rules are enabled on `main` and `master` branches. PRs cannot be merged until all required status checks pass.

## Security Guidelines

We take security seriously. When contributing to MoFA, please follow these security best practices:

### Secret Management

- **NEVER commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data** to the repository
- Use environment variables for configuration secrets
- Add `.env` files to `.gitignore`
- Use placeholder values in examples and documentation

```rust
// DO
let api_key = std::env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY")?;

// DO NOT
let api_key = "sk-abc123...";  // Never hardcode credentials
```

### Secure Coding Practices

- Validate all input parameters
- Sanitize all output data
- Use error handling (avoid `unwrap()` and `expect()` in production code)
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Avoid unsafe code when possible
- Use type-safe interfaces

### Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review security advisories for dependencies
- Use `cargo-audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies:
  ```bash
  cargo install cargo-audit
  cargo audit
  ```
- Use `cargo-deny` to enforce dependency policies:
  ```bash
  cargo install cargo-deny
  cargo deny check
  ```

### Reporting Security Issues

- **DO NOT report security vulnerabilities in public issues or PRs**
- Report security vulnerabilities privately through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/mofa-org/mofa/security/advisories)
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed reporting instructions

For more information on security best practices, see our [Security Guide](docs/security.md).
