 		You are using the client SiliconFlowClient, which will be removed in DSPy 2.6.
 		Changing the client is straightforward and will let you use new features (Adapters) that improve the consistency of LM outputs, especially when using chat LMs.

Agent 1 Output: Answer: "华" (Huá) is a Chinese character with multiple meanings and usages. It can refer to something beautiful or splendid, as in the phrase "华丽" (huálì), which means "magnificent" or "gorgeous." It is also part of the name "华夏" (Huáxià), which historically refers to the Han Chinese people and culture. Additionally, "华" is used in modern times as a shorthand for China or Chinese culture, as seen in terms like "华人" (huárén), meaning "ethnic Chinese person," or "华语" (huáyǔ), meaning "Chinese language."
