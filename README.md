- Use Rhai scripts for business logic (e.g., rule engines, workflow orchestration)
- Seamless interoperability between both, covering 99% of extension scenarios

## Core Features

### 1. Microkernel Architecture
MoFA adopts a **layered microkernel architecture** with `mofa-kernel` at its core. All other features (including plugin system, LLM capabilities, multi-agent collaboration, etc.) are built as modular components on top of the microkernel.

#### Core Design Principles
- **Core Simplicity**: The microkernel contains only the most basic functions: agent lifecycle management, metadata system, and dynamic management
- **High Extensibility**: All advanced features are extended through modular components and plugins, keeping the kernel stable
- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate through standardized interfaces, easy to replace and upgrade

#### Integration with Plugin System
- The plugin system is developed based on the `Plugin` interface of the microkernel. All plugins (including LLM plugins, tool plugins, etc.) are integrated through the `AgentPlugin` standard interface
- The microkernel provides plugin registration center and lifecycle management, supporting plugin hot loading and version control
- LLM capabilities are implemented through `LLMPlugin`, encapsulating LLM providers as plugins compliant with microkernel specifications

#### Integration with LLM
- LLM exists as a plugin component of the microkernel, providing standard LLM access capabilities through the `LLMCapability` interface
- All agent collaboration patterns (chain, parallel, debate, etc.) are built on the microkernel's workflow engine and interact with LLMs through standardized LLM plugin interfaces
- Secretary mode is also implemented based on the microkernel's A2A communication protocol and task scheduling system

### 2. Dual-Layer Plugins
- **Compile-time plugins**: Extreme performance, native integration
- **Runtime plugins**: Dynamic loading, instant effect
- Seamless collaboration between both, covering all scenarios

### 3. Agent Coordination
- **Priority Scheduling**: Task scheduling system based on priority levels
- **Communication Bus**: Built-in inter-agent communication bus
- **Workflow Engine**: Visual workflow builder and executor

### 4. LLM and AI Capabilities
- **LLM Abstraction Layer**: Standardized LLM integration interface
- **OpenAI Support**: Built-in OpenAI API integration
- **ReAct Pattern**: Agent framework based on reasoning and action
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: LLM-driven agent coordination, supporting multiple collaboration modes:
  - **Request-Response**: One-to-one deterministic tasks with synchronous replies
  - **Publish-Subscribe**: One-to-many broadcast tasks with multiple receivers
  - **Consensus**: Multi-round negotiation and voting for decision-making
  - **Debate**: Agents alternate speaking to iteratively refine results
  - **Parallel**: Simultaneous execution with automatic result aggregation
  - **Sequential**: Pipeline execution where output flows to the next agent
  - **Custom**: User-defined modes interpreted by the LLM
- **Secretary Mode**: Provides end-to-end task closed-loop management, including 5 core phases: receive ideas → record todos, clarify requirements → convert to project documents, schedule dispatch → call execution agents, monitor feedback → push key decisions to humans, acceptance report → update todos
  </br>**Features**:
    - 🧠 Autonomous task planning and decomposition
    - 🔄 Intelligent agent scheduling and orchestration
    - 👤 Human intervention at key nodes
    - 📊 Full process observability and traceability
    - 🔁 Closed-loop feedback and continuous optimization

### 5. Persistence Layer
- **Multiple Backends**: Support PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite
- **Session Management**: Persistent agent session storage
- **Memory System**: Stateful agent memory management

### 6. Monitoring & Observability
- **Dashboard**: Built-in web dashboard with real-time metrics
- **Metrics System**: Prometheus-compatible metrics system
- **Tracing Framework**: Distributed tracing system

### 7. Rhai Script Engine

MoFA integrates the [Rhai](https://github.com/rhaiscript/rhai) embedded scripting language, providing **runtime programmability** without recompilation.

#### Script Engine Core
- **Safe Sandbox Execution**: Configurable operation limits, call stack depth, loop control
- **Script Compilation Cache**: Pre-compile scripts for improved repeated execution performance
- **Rich Built-in Functions**: String manipulation, math functions, JSON processing, time utilities
- **Bidirectional JSON Conversion**: Seamless conversion between JSON and Rhai Dynamic types

#### Scripted Workflow Nodes
- **Script Task Nodes**: Execute business logic via scripts
- **Script Condition Nodes**: Dynamic branch decisions
- **Script Transform Nodes**: Data format transformation
- **YAML/JSON Workflow Loading**: Define workflows through configuration files

#### Dynamic Tool System
- **Script-based Tool Definition**: Register tools at runtime
- **Parameter Validation**: Type checking, range validation, enum constraints
- **Auto JSON Schema Generation**: Compatible with LLM Function Calling
- **Hot Loading**: Dynamically load tools from directories

#### Rule Engine
- **Priority Rules**: Critical > High > Normal > Low
- **Multiple Match Modes**: First match, all match, ordered match
- **Composite Actions**: Set variables, trigger events, goto rules
- **Rule Group Management**: Support default fallback actions

#### Typical Application Scenarios
| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Dynamic Business Rules** | Discount strategies, content moderation rules, no redeployment needed |

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add MoFA to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
mofa-sdk = "0.1.0"
```

See [Quick Start](/docs/QuickStart.md) for the full guide!

The runtime mode is most suitable for scenarios that require building complete agent workflows, specifically including:

  ---
1. Multi-agent collaboration scenarios

The runtime provides a message bus (SimpleMessageBus/DoraChannel) and agent registration system, supporting communication between agents:
- Point-to-point communication (send_to_agent)
- Broadcast messages (broadcast)
- Topic pub/sub (publish_to_topic/subscribe_topic)
- Role management (get_agents_by_role)

When you need multiple agents to collaborate on complex tasks (such as master-slave architecture, division of labor), the runtime's communication mechanism can significantly simplify development.

  ---
2. Event-driven agent applications

The runtime has a built-in event loop (run_with_receiver/run_event_loop) and interrupt handling system, automatically managing:
- Event reception and dispatch
- Agent state lifecycle
- Timeout and interrupt handling

Suitable for building applications that need to respond to external events or timers (such as real-time dialogue systems, event response robots).

  ---
3. Distributed agent systems

When the dora feature is enabled, the runtime provides Dora adapters (DoraAgentNode/DoraDataflow), supporting:
- Distributed node deployment
- Cross-node agent communication
- Data flow management

Suitable for production scenarios requiring large-scale deployment and low-latency communication.

  ---
4. Structured agent building

The runtime provides AgentBuilder fluent API, simplifying agent:
- Configuration management
- Plugin integration
- Capability declaration
- Port configuration

Suitable for scenarios where you need to quickly build standardized agents, especially when you need to uniformly manage multiple agent configurations.

  ---
5. Production-grade applications

The runtime provides comprehensive:
- Health checks and state management
- Logging and monitoring integration
- Error handling mechanisms

Suitable for building production applications that need stable operation, rather than simple plugin testing or prototype development.

## CLI Production Smoke Example

To verify CLI production readiness from a user perspective, MoFA includes a
black-box smoke example:

- Path: `examples/cli_production_smoke`
- Runner: invokes the built `mofa` binary in isolated `XDG_*` directories
- Validation: exit codes + stable output tokens (no brittle full snapshots)

Coverage in this smoke run:

- Top-level commands: `info`, `config path`, `config list`
- Agent commands: `start`, `status`, `list`, `restart`, `stop`
- Session commands: `list`, `show`, `export`, `delete`
- Plugin commands: `list`, `info`, `uninstall`
- Tool commands: `list`, `info`

Run it:

```bash
# repo root
cargo build -p mofa-cli

# examples workspace
cd examples
cargo run -p cli_production_smoke
cargo test -p cli_production_smoke
```

Optional binary override:

```bash
export MOFA_BIN=/absolute/path/to/mofa
```

Limitations:

- This smoke flow is manually run (not CI-gated in this PR).
- Assertions focus on behavior and persistence effects, not exact formatting.
