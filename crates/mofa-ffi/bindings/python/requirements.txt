# MoFA Python Bindings Requirements
#
# Note: The mofa module is generated from Rust via UniFFI
# This file lists dependencies for running the Python examples

# No external dependencies required for the bindings themselves
# The mofa module is self-contained and uses ctypes to load the Rust library

# Optional: For development
# pytest>=7.0.0
# black>=22.0.0
# mypy>=0.950
