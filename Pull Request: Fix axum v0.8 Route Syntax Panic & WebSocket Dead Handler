This PR fixes two critical runtime issues in the mofa-monitoring service after upgrading to axum v0.8:

🚨 Route syntax panic caused by outdated route definitions incompatible with axum v0.8.

🔌 WebSocket dead handler issue where closed/disconnected clients caused tasks to hang or panic.

All existing tests pass and additional regression tests have been added to prevent future breakage.
