# MoFA Tutorial: From Zero to Agent Builder

> **Notice:** This tutorial was primarily generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and is pending review by MoFA architect [@lijingrs](https://github.com/lijingrs). Content may be updated as the review progresses.

Welcome to the MoFA (Modular Framework for Agents) tutorial! This guide is designed for **Google Summer of Code** students and anyone who wants to learn how to build AI agents with Rust using MoFA's microkernel architecture.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand MoFA's architecture and be able to build, extend, and orchestrate AI agents confidently.

| [05](05-tools.md) | Tools & Function Calling | ~60 min | Agent with calculator & weather tools |
| [06](06-multi-agent.md) | Multi-Agent Coordination | ~45 min | Chain & parallel agent pipelines |
| [07](07-workflows.md) | Workflows with StateGraph | ~60 min | Customer support workflow |
| [08](08-plugins-and-scripting.md) | Plugins & Scripting | ~45 min | Hot-reloadable Rhai content filter |
| [09](09-whats-next.md) | What's Next | ~15 min | Your contribution roadmap |

**Total estimated time: 4-6 hours**

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (1.85+): Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **An LLM provider** (one of):
  - OpenAI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), or
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) running locally (free, no API key needed)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- Basic familiarity with a terminal

> **New to Rust?** Don't worry. Each chapter includes "Rust tip" sidebars that explain key language concepts (traits, async/await, `Arc`) as they come up. You don't need to be a Rust expert to follow along.

## Quick Links

- [QuickStart Guide](../QuickStart.md) - Get running in under 10 minutes
- [Architecture Reference](../architecture.md) - Deep architecture documentation
- [Contributing Guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) - How to contribute to MoFA
- [Security Guide](../security.md) - Security best practices
- [SDK README](../../crates/mofa-sdk/README.md) - SDK API reference

## How to Use This Tutorial

1. **Follow the chapters in order** - each builds on the previous one
2. **Type the code yourself** - don't just copy-paste (you'll learn more)
3. **Run every example** - seeing output builds intuition
4. **Read the "Architecture note" callouts** - they connect code to design decisions
5. **Check the linked source files** - real code is the best documentation
